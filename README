===========================Jacktheripper's Grooveshark Downloader===========================

A downloader to Grooveshark's awesome music library. Based off the wiki at
http://nettech.wikia.com/wiki/Grooveshark_Internal_API.

For now, only a python version with optional GUI is available.
Dependencies:
		1) Python 2.6
For GUI:
		2) wxPython (http://www.wxpython.org)
		3) ObjectListView (http://objectlistview.sourceforge.net/python)
If you're a windows user that doesn't have python, nor know what it is, 
you could just install groove-dl_*.*all.exe from the downloads section. 
If you're a linux user however, you have to do it the right way.

Run `groove.py "search query"` or `groove.py --gui` if GUI is needed.

I'm not responsible for any violations this script does to Grooveshark's TOS. It's more of a
proof of concept.
