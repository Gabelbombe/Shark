====================Jacktheripper's Grooveshark Downloader====================

A downloader to Grooveshark's awesome music library. Based off the wiki at
http://nettech.wikia.com/wiki/Grooveshark_Internal_API.

For now, only a python version is available.
A firefox plugin version is planned.

I'm not responsible for any violations this script does to Grooveshark's
TOS. It's more of a proof of concept.
